The First step is generation of data. 

This has to be done using the notebooks in **Data PreProcessing** Folder.
- In this folder, run both to generate Pixelated and Blur images.
- The data will be stored in an `.npz` file.

Next the CNN Model can be found in the **Models** folder
- Every experiment included in the report is shown here as different notebooks.
- The outputs are preserved to scroll though.
- For a better experience, look at them though Google Colab where the code was built.
- All intermediate data are preserved. You will have to update the data paths to run them yourself. If updated, you can simply hit run-all to run them.
